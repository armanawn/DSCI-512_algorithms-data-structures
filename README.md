## Lab Assignments

There will be one lab assignment per week. We will follow the standard MDS lab deadlines.

## Quizzes

Quizzes will be **open book**, meaning you may consult course materials, online sources, Python, etc. However, communication with other people during the quiz is strictly forbidden. See the MDS quiz instructions [here](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/quiz/). For the dates/times of the quizzes, see the [MDS calendar](https://ubc-mds.github.io/calendar/).

## Installation

The course's conda environment file is [here](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2022-23/DSCI_512_alg-data-struct_students/blob/master/dsci512env.yml). To create the environment: `conda env create -f dsci512env.yml` (you only need to do this once). To activate the environment: `conda activate dsci512env` (you need this for each new terminal window). In short, run `conda install -c conda-forge nb_conda_kernels` in your **base** environment (this only has to be done once across all courses, so you may have done it already), then launch Jupyter Lab from your **base** environment, and finally select the `dsci512env` kernel from within Jupyter.

## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:

1. Analyze the scalability and trade-offs of various basic algorithms and data structures using Big-O notation.
2. Read and interpret recursive functions.
3. Select appropriate data structures, such as graphs, given a data set. 
4. Map certain real-world problems to discrete optimization problems.
5. Diagnose rate-limiting aspects of slow Python code and enumerate various options for speeding it up.
