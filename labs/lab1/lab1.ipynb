However, it's definitely good practice in _using_ Python data structures like dictionaries. There are some more challenging questions about time/space complexity at the end, which you can skip if you don't have enough time for them. Overall, this is not a perfect thematic fit with DSCI 512, but it's very good practice (and hopefully fun!)."

Say we pick \"e\". Then our output text is now \"is e\" but our current $n$-gram is just \"s e\" because we're only using $n=3$.

    "You will implement the above algorithm in a class called `MarkovModel`. Your class will have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`, which is already implemented for you.\n",
    "- `fit`, which calculates and stores the _frequencies_ of all possible next characters given an $n$-gram. These frequencies should be stored in a `dict` of `dicts`, where the keys of the outer `dict` are the $n$-grams and the keys of the inner `dict` are the possible next characters, and the values of the inner `dict` are the frequencies (counts). Then, at the end of `fit`, normalize these frequencies into empirical probabilities and store them in `self.probabilities`.\n",
    "**Note:** before starting the calculations, append the first $n$ characters of your corpus to the end of the corpus, making it \"circular\"; this will avoid a situation where you your `generate` function might get stuck when your loop reaches the end of the corpus.\n",
    "- `generate`, which creates a random text of a specified length by generating one character at a time from the appropriate (discrete) probability distribution. To perform the random sampling, use the parameter `p=` of `np.random.choice`. You can start the output text with the first $n$ characters of the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** you may find some of the fancy dictionaries in the [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html) package useful, namely `defaultdict` and/or `Counter`. However, you can also just use `dict`; either way is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** if you find yourself searching for all occurrences of an $n$-gram in the text, you are approaching this incorrectlyâ€”in that case, ask us for help!"
